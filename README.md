Hello, here is the data repository hosting all the real time data.
The data (news and price) is collected from 9am EST to 5pm EST.
The server is located at central time, and hence the data shows from 8am to 4pm. 

DO NOT TOUCH data_ticker.csv, price_ticker.csv, test.py and test2.py from 9am EST to 5pm EST. 
data_ticker.csv and price_ticker.csv can be modified after hours, please keep the format the same.
